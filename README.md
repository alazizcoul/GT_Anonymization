        ASTRACT

        
This research explores the challenges and opportunities related to data protection, with a particular focus on survey data anonymization. The objective is to propose an anonymization procedure that integrates methods such as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) and advancements in synthetic data generation, while considering legal and ethical requirements. A proposed anonymization procedure utilizes SDC and synthetic data generation models (GANs and Gaussian copulas), based on a contextual data preparation inspired by the SDC procedure. The effectiveness of the methods is compared to ensure individual privacy and data utility. The results show that generative models are superior to SDC in terms of privacy. However, they tend to overestimate or underestimate certain dependencies between variables. This makes traditional SDC a suitable procedure for SUF-type anonymizations, while generative models, notably Copula GAN and TVAE, are well-suited for PUF. This study contributes to the advancement of privacy protection practices in social surveys by proposing solutions to reconcile privacy and data sharing for research.
